I have used PyCharm and set venv. But it is not necessary, just need
to specify python.exe file path or add it to environment variable. In
general, it is more convenient to use venv.

##### To launch the project:

##### Comments:
1. I haven't separated the program by modules because logically because it is too simple
to create complex structure
2. I have used pandas in testing csv because it is the fastest and I have experience
with it
